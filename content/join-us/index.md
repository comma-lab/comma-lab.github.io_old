We are always keen for motivated people to come and work with us.
COMMA includes researchers from many different disciplines, from engineering and mathematics to music and acoustics.
We are part of the world-leading [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) and enjoy collaborations with departments across QMUL, including [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Music Cognition](http://music-cognition.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Advanced Robotics](https://www.robotics.qmul.ac.uk/), and [Maths](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/research/statistics-and-data-science/).
[We are located]({{ ref . "contact" }}) in Mile End in East London, with excellent transport links and an active campus.

If you are interested in joining us, please reach out with a CV and short proposal. Projects should address psychologically or technologically relevant questions in communication acoustics, digital music, or [social interaction](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/research/faculties-and-research-centres/science-and-engineering/social-interaction-health-and-wellbeing/).

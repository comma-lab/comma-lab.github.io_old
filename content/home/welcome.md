The **Communication Acoustics Lab** is a research group within the [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), conducting cutting edge research into the ways we perceive sound and technologies for improving communication.

<small>
Our research themes include:

* Perception, cognition & aesthetics of sound
* Cross-sensory perception involving sound
* Enabling digital audio systems with an understanding of how we listen
* Modelling human values (and biases) with multimodal music data
* Digital tools for education, outreach, and research

The **Communication Acoustics Lab (COMMA)** is part of the [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) (C4DM) at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), conducting cutting edge research into the ways we perceive sound and technologies for improving communication.

<small>
We work across disciplines of music, engineering, psychology, and cognitive science to study communication between humans and between humans and machines.


Our research themes include:

* Perception, cognition & aesthetics of sound
* Cross-sensory perception involving sound
* Enabling digital audio systems with an understanding of how we listen
* Modelling human values (and biases) with multimodal music data
* Digital tools for education, outreach, and research 

<br>

COMMA was founded in 2021 by Charalampos Saitis. Members and collaborators come from across C4DM and the [School of EECS](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), including PhD students on the [Artificial Intelligence & Music](http://aim.qmul.ac.uk/) (AIM), [Data-informed Audience-centric Media Engineering](https://dame.qmul.ac.uk/) (DAME), and [China Scholarship Council](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/scholarships/items/china-scholarship-council-scholarships.html) (QMUL-CSC) programmes.

The lab has received funding from the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/), [SSHRC-ACTOR](https://www.actorproject.org/), and [QMUL's Centre for Public Engagement](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/publicengagement/about-engagement/centre-for-public-engagement/).

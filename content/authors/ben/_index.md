I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Music at [Queen Mary University of London](https://qmul.ac.uk/). My research bridges neural audio synthesis, the psychoacoustics of musical timbre, and applications of meta-learning to audio. I am very grateful to be funded by the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in [Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://aim.qmul.ac.uk/), and am a member of the [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/).

Previously, I was Music Lead at the award-winning AI-driven generative music startup [Jukedeck](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jukedeck/about/), who were acquired by [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/). I also [make music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/73A1Xo6NzkbRB2EIw3dm6R).

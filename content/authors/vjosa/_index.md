I am part of the Data-informed Audience-centric Media Engineering (DAME) CDT at Queen Mary University of London. My research is focused on finding associations between human moral values, personalities, and music-listening preferences by using ML/AI tools and leveraging the power of music streaming and digital media trails. Such insight can support building predictive models of complex high-level psychological constructs and multimodal personalized recommendation systems. My project is in collaboration with the BBC and the Data Science Lab at ISI Foundation.

Previously, I was Chevening Scholar and co-founder of NGO Education Code, whose mission was to support and increase the opportunities for Women in Tech. I also have some industrial experience as Data Scientist: I worked for Drax company in London and then later for Quantix LLC in Prishtina.

This involves using empirical and computational methods to understand different modalities of experience, interaction, and control between the digital music “user” (listeners, performers, producers) and sound as a multimodal semiotic system. My previous research has focused on verbal-data-driven analysis of cognitive representations of timbre and more recently on digital interactive cross-sensory games. Scholarly contributions include co-editing the scientific volumes Timbre: Acoustics, Perception, \u0026amp; Cognition (2019), the first dedicated to a comprehensive and authoritative presentation of the state of the art in research on this foundational aspect of hearing, and Musical Haptics (2018), an original interdisciplinary overview of the role of haptic feedback in musical practice and interaction. I am a founding member of the International Conference on Timbre.\nI am associate member of the Music Cognition Lab and the Cognitive Science Research Group, member of the Institute of Applied Data Science (IADS), deputy director of the DAME CDT, and coordinate the C4DM Special Interest Group in Neural Audio Synthesis (SIGNAS). Outside QMUL, I am active in the UK Acoustics Network (UKAN), non-partner member of the international Analysis, Creation and Teaching of ORchestration (ACTOR) Partnership, and Turing Fellow and member of the Humanities \u0026amp; Data Science interest group at the Alan Turing Institute. I was awarded a PhD in music technology from McGill University in 2014. In 2015-16, I joined Fondazione ISI as postdoc in the data science lab. Prior to joining QMUL, I was Humboldt Research Fellow at the [Audio Communication Group](Audio Communication Group) of TU Berlin in 2016-19.\nI am a member of the EECS Equalities Committee, EECS Race Equality Champion, and a member of the QMUL Racial Equality Action Group.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9be6119142758e5d2fe06a5352446fb6","permalink":"https://comma-lab.github.io/author/charalampos-saitis/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/charalampos-saitis/","section":"authors","summary":"I am based at the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), where I study communication acoustics with a focus on timbre perception and “metaphors we listen with”, and their application to research and innovation in digital music.","tags":null,"title":"Charalampos Saitis","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Wowchemy\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
